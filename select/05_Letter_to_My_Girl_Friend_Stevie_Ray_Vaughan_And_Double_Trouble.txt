I wants to know what your doing tonight
Wish I could see if everything was alright
Hold you long in my arms until it's light
Your smiling face would make a wonderful sight
I wants to be with ya, love with ya, eat with ya
Sleep with ya, stay with me all of my life

I loved ya darling when ya's only sixteen
Was the sweetest thing to enter my dream
When we're together then my life is fulfilled
I love you darling I know I always will
I wants to be with ya, love with ya, eat with ya
Sleep with ya, stay with me all of my life

I close my letter but never my love
Take it there to ya Heaven above
Get me back to you safe and sound
The day that I leave the prisoners ground
I wants to be with ya, love with ya
Stay with ya, sleep with ya all of my life
